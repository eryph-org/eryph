# Installation

> ðŸ”” **Security Notice!**   
Please inspect https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eryph-org/eryph/main/src/apps/src/Eryph-zero/install.ps1 before running any of these scripts to ensure safety. We already know it's safe, but you should check the security and content of any script from the Internet that you're not familiar with. All of these scripts download a remote PowerShell script and run it on your computer.

## Enable Hyper-V

Before running the script below, you should enable Hyper-V to avoid running the script twice, as it will automatically enable Hyper-V if it is not installed, which requires a reboot. 
Follow these instructions to enable Hyper-V on your machine:
